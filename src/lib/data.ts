        overview: "A material physics study exploring the behavior of whisky in motion—viscosity-driven pour dynamics, meniscus formation at glass edges, amber light transmission through curved crystal. This treatment demonstrates how 15 years of physics-based rendering knowledge directs AI toward material truth rather than approximation.",
